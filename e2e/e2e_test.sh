# End-to-end test for `ai-harness install` and the OpenCode harness it produces.
#
# Tiers (each runs only when its prerequisite tool is present):
#   1. Install (always)      — build ai-harness, install into a clean HOME, and
#                              assert the generated opencode.json, symlinks, and
#                              command files are correct. Hermetic, no network.
#   2. OpenCode config-load  — requires the `opencode` binary. Proves OpenCode
#                              actually parses our agent graph (gentle-orchestrator
#                              + hidden subagents) and loads the plugin, with no
#                              LLM/auth (`opencode agent list`).
#   3a. Plugin unit test     — requires `bun`. Runs the model-variants unit test.
#   3b. Live smoke (gated)    — requires RUN_LIVE_SMOKE=1 and a configured provider
#                              key. Runs a real `opencode run` and checks the plugin
#                              wrote a non-empty model-variants cache. NOT hermetic.
#
# Exit code is non-zero if any assertion failed.
