# Information Hiding and Leakage — how you MAKE modules deep

Deep modules are the goal; **information hiding is the primary technique** for
reaching it. Each module should encapsulate a piece of *knowledge* — a design
decision — that lives in its implementation but is **invisible through its
interface**.

Things worth hiding: data structures, algorithms, low-level details (page size,
buffer size), the choice of B-tree vs. hash table, an on-disk or wire format, a
unit, an invariant. The payoff is twofold:

1. **Simpler interface** → less the caller must learn (a deeper module).
2. **Easier evolution** → if the knowledge is hidden, changing it touches ONLY
   that module, never its callers.

### ✅ POSITIVE — hide the decision, expose only the need

```java
// GOOD: callers see get/put. Whether it's a HashMap today or a B-tree
// tomorrow is the module's secret. Swap the structure → no caller changes.
class KeyValueStore {
    String get(String key)            { /* structure hidden here */ }
    void   put(String key, String v)  { /* same secret, one home */ }
}
```

The deepest modules hide enormous knowledge behind almost no interface — a
**garbage collector** hides when memory is freed, how it's reclaimed, and
compaction strategy behind essentially *zero* interface. The secret is so well
hidden the caller never even invokes it.

```java
// GOOD: defaults hide complexity. The caller sees one simple call;
// timestamp formatting, severity routing, output destination stay secret.
logger.log("disk full");
```

### ❌ NEGATIVE — leaking the decision through the interface

```java
// BAD: the interface advertises "we store data as a sorted int array".
// Every caller now depends on that choice. Switch to a B-tree → all break.
public int[] getRawIndexArray();
```

### ❌ NEGATIVE — back-door leakage (the invisible kind)

The sneakiest form: **nothing in either interface mentions the secret**, yet two
modules silently depend on the same assumption. Invisible until you change one
and the other breaks.

```java
// Module A writes a temp file...
saveToTemp("/tmp/cache.dat", data);   // assumes a specific binary layout
// Module B reads it elsewhere...
parseBinary("/tmp/cache.dat");        // ALSO assumes the same layout
// The format is leaked through a back door — no signature reveals the coupling.
```

### ❌ NEGATIVE — defensive re-checking (the most common leak in app code)

The sneakiest leak in everyday application code does not look like a leak — it
looks like *caution*. The instinct "never trust input, sanitize at every layer"
feels safe, so the same check is repeated at every level:

```java
// BAD: "what is a valid, clean username?" is decided in THREE places.
String clean = sanitize(input);     // the HTTP layer sanitizes...
validate(clean);                    // ...validates...
service.register(clean);            // ...then the service re-sanitizes "to be safe":
//   register(name)   { String c = sanitize(name); insert(c); }   // again
//   isTaken(name)    { String c = sanitize(name); query(c);  }   // and again
```

Why it's bad: the decision *"what makes a username valid and clean"* now lives in
three modules. Change the rule (also strip quotes, allow dots) and you must find
and edit every copy — **change amplification** — and if you miss one, two layers
silently disagree about what a "clean" username even is. Worse, the inner checks
are often a **no-op that masquerades as safety**: if the boundary already
validated the charset, the inner `sanitize` can never change anything — it is
dead code wearing a security costume. It adds cognitive load ("why is this here?
what does it protect against?") while protecting nothing.

### ✅ POSITIVE — decide once at the trust boundary, then trust inward

Make the decision in exactly ONE place — the boundary where untrusted input
enters — produce a single canonical value, and let every inner layer trust the
value it was handed.

```java
// GOOD: the boundary owns "valid, clean username". Inner layers receive an
// already-canonical value and never second-guess it.
String username = parseUsername(input);   // validate + normalize, ONCE, here
service.register(username);               // the service trusts its input:
//   register(name)   { insert(name); }    // no re-sanitize
//   isTaken(name)    { query(name);  }     // no re-sanitize
```

Now the rule has one home. Change it once; no layer can disagree; there is no
dead defensive check left for the next reader to puzzle over.

### Where the line actually is — re-checking ACROSS trust boundaries is correct

This does NOT mean "never validate twice." Re-checking is RIGHT when the second
check crosses a **different trust boundary**: a backend MUST re-validate what a
browser already validated, because it cannot trust the browser. Those two checks
own *different* decisions — "convenient UX feedback" vs. "the server's actual
contract" — that merely look alike. The leak is when the SAME decision, inside
the SAME trust boundary (one process, layers that already trust each other), is
copied. The test:

> *Are these two checks defending against different threats, or repeating one
> decision?* Different threats → keep both. One decision twice → one home.

> **Information leakage** = the same design decision reflected in more than one
> module, coupling them through shared knowledge. The classic cause is
> **temporal decomposition** — splitting by *order of execution* instead of by
> *knowledge* — covered in detail in `classes.md` (Red flag #1).

**The red flag, stated plainly:** if you can't understand or change module A
without also understanding module B, knowledge is leaking between them.

### Hide information WITHIN a class too, not just across classes

Information hiding applies at every scope. Minimize what methods expose to each
other; prefer `private` over `public`; don't let one method depend on another's
internal state when a parameter would make the dependency explicit.

### The counter-balance — do NOT over-hide

Hiding information a caller **genuinely needs** is itself a design error. If you
bury something callers must have (a timeout they must tune, a status they must
read), they build clumsy workarounds — and that workaround becomes a *new* leak.
The rule is precise: **hide the decisions callers shouldn't care about; expose
what they legitimately need.**

### The one question that drives this whole section

For every element you're about to put in an interface, ask:

> *"Is this knowledge the caller genuinely NEEDS, or am I leaking a decision I
> could have kept secret?"*

- "Caller needs the user's name" → expose it. ✅
- "Caller needs to know we cache in a `HashMap<String, byte[]>`" → leak. ❌

### Rules of thumb (information hiding)

- **Encapsulate each design decision in ONE module**, hidden behind its
  interface. One decision, one home.
- **Hide:** data structures, algorithms, formats, low-level constants, the
  choice of mechanism. **Expose:** only what the caller must know to use it.
- **Watch for back-door leakage** — shared assumptions (a file format, a temp
  path layout) that no signature reveals. These are the unknown-unknowns.
- **Validate/normalize at the trust boundary, then trust inward.** Re-checking
  the same decision in inner layers of the same process is leakage, not safety —
  and often a dead no-op. Re-checking ACROSS a trust boundary (a server
  re-validating a client) is correct: different threat, different decision.
- **Don't over-hide.** If a caller truly needs it, exposing it is correct;
  hiding it just spawns workarounds.
- When the same knowledge appears in two modules, factor it into one owner (see
  `classes.md`).

### Checklist before exposing anything in an interface

1. Does the caller genuinely NEED this, or am I leaking an internal decision?
2. Is any design decision (format, structure, algorithm, unit) reflected in more
   than one module? If yes, give it a single owner.
3. Is there a back-door dependency — shared state, a temp file, a fixed path or
   layout — that no signature reveals?
4. Am I re-validating or re-sanitizing a value that an inner layer already
   received from a trusted caller in the same process? If the check defends no
   NEW threat, remove it and decide once at the boundary.
5. Within the class, am I exposing method internals that could stay private?
6. Am I over-hiding something the caller must have, forcing a workaround?
