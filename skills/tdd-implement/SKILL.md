description: The strict TDD method — red→green→refactor with triangulation and assertion-quality
  rules — for an implementer sub-agent. Pure methodology: the task, the spec, and the testing
  capabilities are SUPPLIED in the prompt; this skill governs only HOW to drive implementation
  through tests, never WHERE the spec comes from nor how to style the code. Language-agnostic.

# Strict TDD — Method

> **This is a METHOD skill.** It tells you HOW to drive implementation through tests.
> It does NOT tell you where the task or spec come from (the orchestrator supplies those in
> your prompt) nor how to style the code (a separate coding-guidelines skill covers that).
> Read those companion skills first if their paths were injected into your prompt, then apply
> this method to the single task you were assigned.

## TDD Philosophy

TDD is not testing. TDD is **software design driven by tests**. You write a test that describes what the code SHOULD do, then write the minimum code to make it real. The tests design the API, the contracts, the behavior. Code is a side effect of tests.

### The Three Laws

1. **Do NOT write production code** until you have a failing test
2. **Do NOT write more test** than is necessary to fail
3. **Do NOT write more code** than is necessary to pass the test

## TDD Implementation Cycle

You were assigned ONE task. Drive it to completion with this cycle, looping RED→GREEN→TRIANGULATE→REFACTOR once per spec scenario the task covers:

```
FOR THE TASK ASSIGNED TO YOU:
├── 0. SAFETY NET (only if modifying existing files)
│   ├── Run existing tests for files being modified
│   ├── Capture baseline: "{N} tests passing"
│   ├── If any FAIL → STOP, report as "pre-existing failure"
│   │   (do NOT fix pre-existing failures — report it back)
│   └── This baseline proves you did not break what already worked
│
├── 1. UNDERSTAND
│   ├── Read the task description (supplied in your prompt)
│   ├── Read relevant spec scenarios (these ARE your acceptance criteria)
│   ├── Read the design decisions (these CONSTRAIN your approach)
│   ├── Read existing code and test patterns (match the style)
│   └── Determine test layer (see "Choosing Test Layer" below)
│
├── 2. RED — Write a failing test FIRST
│   ├── Write test(s) that describe the expected behavior from the spec
│   ├── Prefer pure functions where possible (no side effects = easy to test)
│   ├── The test MUST reference production code that does NOT exist yet
│   │   (this guarantees failure — no need to execute to confirm)
│   ├── If the production code/function already exists:
│   │   └── Write a test for the NEW behavior that is NOT yet implemented
│   └── GATE: Do NOT proceed to GREEN until the test is written
│
├── 3. GREEN — Write the MINIMUM code to pass
│   ├── Implement ONLY what the failing test needs
│   ├── Fake It is VALID here (hardcoded return values are OK)
│   ├── EXECUTE tests → must PASS
│   │   ├── ✅ Passed → proceed to TRIANGULATE or REFACTOR
│   │   └── ❌ Failed → fix the implementation, NOT the test
│   └── GATE: Do NOT proceed until GREEN is confirmed by execution
│
├── 4. TRIANGULATE (MANDATORY for most behaviors)
│   ├── DEFAULT: triangulation is REQUIRED. You need a compelling reason to skip it.
│   ├── Add a second test case with DIFFERENT inputs/expected outputs
│   ├── EXECUTE tests → if Fake It breaks (hardcoded no longer works):
│   │   └── Generalize to real logic (this is the whole point)
│   ├── Repeat until ALL spec scenarios for this task are covered
│   ├── Each triangulation pass: write test → run → fix implementation
│   ├── MINIMUM: at least 2 test cases per behavior (happy path + one edge case)
│   │   ├── One test with data that produces a NON-EMPTY/NON-TRIVIAL result
│   │   └── One test with data that exercises a DIFFERENT code path
│   ├── WATCH OUT for GREEN that passes trivially:
│   │   ├── If your test passes because the component/element isn't rendered → NOT a real GREEN
│   │   ├── If your test passes because a loop iterates 0 times → NOT a real GREEN
│   │   ├── If your test passes because the setup doesn't trigger the code path → NOT a real GREEN
│   │   └── A real GREEN means: production code RAN and produced the expected output
│   ├── Skip triangulation ONLY when ALL of these are true:
│   │   ├── The task is purely structural (config file, constant definition, type export)
│   │   ├── There is literally ONE possible output (no branching, no logic)
│   │   └── You explicitly note "Triangulation skipped: {reason}" in the evidence table
│   └── GATE: All spec scenarios for this task must have tests before REFACTOR
│
├── 5. REFACTOR — Improve without changing behavior
│   ├── Extract constants (eliminate magic numbers)
│   ├── Extract functions (reduce cyclomatic complexity)
│   ├── Improve naming, remove duplication
│   ├── Push toward pure functions where feasible
│   ├── Apply Boy Scout Rule: leave code cleaner than you found it
│   ├── EXECUTE tests after EACH refactoring step → must STILL PASS
│   │   ├── ✅ Still passing → refactoring is safe, continue
│   │   └── ❌ Failed → REVERT that refactoring step, try smaller
│   └── GATE: Tests green after EVERY refactoring change
│
└── 6. Note any deviations or issues discovered, then return your evidence
```

> Marking the task done in the task list is NOT your job — the orchestrator gates that after a
> separate validation pass. Your job ends when the task's tests are green and the tree is clean.

## Choosing Test Layer

The testing capabilities (language, test runner, available layers, conventions) are SUPPLIED to you in the prompt. If they are absent, detect them from the repo manifest (`pyproject.toml`/`pytest` → Python; `go.mod` → Go; `package.json` → JS/TS). Then choose the appropriate test layer for the task:

```
Determine test layer by WHAT the task does:
├── Pure logic, utility function, calculation, data transformation
│   └── Unit test (always available if test runner exists)
│
├── Component rendering, user interaction, state changes
│   ├── IF integration tools available → Integration test
│   └── IF NOT → Unit test with mocks (degrade gracefully)
│
├── Multi-component flow, API interaction, context/provider behavior
│   ├── IF integration tools available → Integration test
│   └── IF NOT → Unit test with mocks
│
├── Critical business flow, full user journey, cross-page navigation
│   ├── IF E2E tools available → E2E test
│   ├── IF NOT but integration available → Integration test
│   └── IF neither → Unit test (degrade gracefully)
│
└── Default: Unit test (always the fallback)
```

**Key rule**: Use the HIGHEST available layer that fits the task. But NEVER skip a task because a layer is unavailable — degrade to the next available layer.

## Test Execution

Use the test command SUPPLIED to you. If none was given, detect it from the repo manifest (`package.json`/`pyproject.toml`/`go.mod`).

```
When executing tests during TDD:
├── Run ONLY the relevant test file, not the entire suite
│   ├── JS/TS: {runner} {test-file-path} (e.g., pnpm vitest run src/utils/tax.test.ts)
│   ├── Python: pytest {test-file-path}
│   ├── Go: go test ./{package}/... -run {TestName}
│   └── Adapt to the runner's CLI
├── This keeps the cycle FAST
└── Full-suite runs happen in the validation phase, not here
```

## Pure Function Preference

When writing production code in GREEN/TRIANGULATE steps, prefer pure functions:

```
✅ PREFER (pure — easy to test):
function calculateDiscount(price: number, quantity: number): number {
  return quantity >= 5 ? price * quantity * 0.1 : 0
}

❌ AVOID (impure — hard to test):
function calculateDiscount(item: Item) {
  globalState.lastDiscount = item.price * 0.1  // side effect
  updateDOM()                                   // side effect
  return globalState.lastDiscount
}
```

**Why**: Pure functions are deterministic (same input → same output), have no side effects, and are trivially testable. TDD naturally pushes you toward pure functions — embrace it.

## Approval Testing (for refactoring existing code)

When a task involves REFACTORING existing code (not writing new code):

```
BEFORE touching production code:
├── 1. Identify existing behavior to preserve
├── 2. Write "approval tests" that capture current behavior:
│   ├── Call the function with known inputs
│   ├── Assert the CURRENT outputs (even if ugly or wrong)
│   └── These tests document what the code does NOW
├── 3. Run approval tests → must PASS (they describe current reality)
├── 4. NOW refactor the production code
├── 5. Run approval tests again → must STILL PASS
│   ├── ✅ Passing → refactoring preserved behavior
│   └── ❌ Failing → refactoring broke something, revert
└── 6. If the spec says behavior should CHANGE:
    ├── Update the approval test to reflect NEW expected behavior
    ├── Run → test FAILS (RED — new behavior not implemented yet)
    └── Implement new behavior → GREEN
```

## Return Summary

Your return summary MUST include this section so the validation phase can audit your TDD cycle:

```markdown
### TDD Cycle Evidence
| Task | Test File | Layer | Safety Net | RED | GREEN | TRIANGULATE | REFACTOR |
|------|-----------|-------|------------|-----|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1.1 | `path/test.ext` | Unit | ✅ 5/5 | ✅ Written | ✅ Passed | ✅ 3 cases | ✅ Clean |
| 1.2 | `path/test.ext` | Integration | N/A (new) | ✅ Written | ✅ Passed | ➖ Single | ✅ Clean |
| 1.3 | `path/test.ext` | Unit | ✅ 2/2 | ✅ Written | ✅ Passed | ✅ 2 cases | ➖ None needed |

### Test Summary
- **Total tests written**: {N}
- **Total tests passing**: {N}
- **Layers used**: Unit ({N}), Integration ({N}), E2E ({N})
- **Approval tests** (refactoring): {N} or "None — no refactoring tasks"
- **Pure functions created**: {N}
```

**Column definitions**:
- **Safety Net**: Pre-existing tests run before modifying files. "N/A (new)" for new files.
- **RED**: Test written first, referencing code that doesn't exist yet. Always "✅ Written".
- **GREEN**: Tests executed and passing after minimal implementation. Must show execution result.
- **TRIANGULATE**: Additional test cases added to force real logic. "➖ Single" if spec has only one scenario.
- **REFACTOR**: Code improved with tests still passing. "➖ None needed" if code was already clean.

## Assertion Quality Rules (MANDATORY)

**Every assertion must verify REAL behavior.** A test that passes without exercising production logic is worse than no test — it gives false confidence.

### Banned Assertion Patterns (NEVER write these)

```
# TRIVIAL ASSERTIONS — test proves nothing
expect(true).toBe(true)              # ❌ Tautology
expect(false).toBe(false)            # ❌ Tautology
expect(1).toBe(1)                    # ❌ Tautology — no production code involved
assert True                          # ❌ Always passes
assert 1 == 1                        # ❌ Always passes

# EMPTY COLLECTION ASSERTIONS without setup context
expect(result).toEqual([])           # ❌ ONLY valid if you set up conditions for empty
expect(result).toHaveLength(0)       # ❌ Same — why is it empty? Did production code run?
assert len(result) == 0              # ❌ Same — prove the emptiness comes from real logic
assert result == []                  # ❌ Same

# TYPE-ONLY ASSERTIONS — proves existence, not behavior
expect(result).toBeDefined()         # ❌ Alone is useless — WHAT is the value?
expect(result).not.toBeNull()        # ❌ Alone is useless — assert the actual value
expect(typeof result).toBe('object') # ❌ Alone is useless — what does the object contain?
assert result is not None            # ❌ Alone — assert what result actually IS

# GHOST LOOP — assertion inside a loop that iterates 0 times
const items = screen.queryAllByTestId("item");  // returns []
for (const item of items) {
  expect(item).toHaveTextContent("value");       # ❌ NEVER EXECUTES — loop body is dead code
}
# FIX: assert the collection is non-empty FIRST, or set up data so it IS non-empty:
expect(items).toHaveLength(3);                   # ✅ Proves items exist
for (const item of items) { ... }                # ✅ Now the loop actually runs

# INCOMPLETE TDD CYCLE — GREEN without TRIANGULATE
# If your GREEN test passes because the setup doesn't exercise the code path,
# you are NOT done. You MUST triangulate with a setup that DOES exercise it.
# Example: testing "search doesn't update until Enter" but the component
# that receives the search is never rendered → the test proves nothing.
# FIX: add a test where the component IS rendered and verify the behavior.
```

### What Makes a REAL Assertion

Every test assertion must satisfy ALL of these:
1. **Calls production code** — the test invokes a function, method, or component from the implementation
2. **Asserts a specific output** — compares against a concrete expected value derived from the spec
3. **Would FAIL if the production code were wrong** — if you change the implementation logic, THIS test breaks

```
# ✅ REAL assertions — production code determines the result
expect(calculateDiscount(100, 10)).toBe(10)       # Real input → real output
expect(screen.getByText('Welcome, John')).toBeInTheDocument()  # Rendered from data
assert result[0].status == "FAIL"                  # Specific finding from check execution
assert response.status_code == 403                 # Real HTTP response from the endpoint
expect(result).toHaveLength(3)                     # AND you set up exactly 3 items
```

### Empty Collection Rule

`expect(result).toEqual([])` or `assert len(result) == 0` is ONLY valid when:
1. You set up a specific precondition that SHOULD produce an empty result (e.g., no matching records)
2. The production code actually ran and filtered/processed data to arrive at empty
3. A companion test with different setup produces a NON-EMPTY result (triangulation)

If you cannot explain WHY the result is empty based on setup → the assertion is trivial.

### Smoke Test Rule

A test that only renders a component without asserting any output is NOT a valid test:

```
# ❌ SMOKE TEST ONLY — proves nothing about behavior
render(<MyComponent data={mockData} />);
expect(screen.getByTestId("wrapper")).toBeInTheDocument();  # Just proves it rendered

# ✅ BEHAVIORAL TEST — proves what the component DOES with the data
render(<MyComponent data={mockData} />);
expect(screen.getByText("Expected Title")).toBeInTheDocument();  # Verifies output from data
expect(screen.getByRole("button")).toHaveTextContent("Submit");  # Verifies real content
```

"Renders without crash" is a smoke test. It is NOT a unit test, NOT an integration test, and it does NOT count toward TDD coverage. If you need a smoke test, it must be accompanied by real behavioral assertions.

### Mock Hygiene Rules

**If you need more mocks than assertions, you are testing at the WRONG level.**

```
Mock/assertion ratio guide:
├── ≤ 3 mocks for a test file → ✅ Healthy — focused test
├── 4–6 mocks → ⚠️ Consider extracting logic to a pure function
├── 7+ mocks → ❌ STOP — you are testing at the wrong layer
│   ├── Extract the logic under test to a PURE FUNCTION and test it without mocks
│   ├── OR move the test to integration/E2E layer where real dependencies exist
│   └── NEVER write 10+ mocks to verify a one-line transformation
```

**Extract-Before-Mock Rule**: If the behavior you want to test is a data transformation, mapping, filtering, or conditional logic (e.g., `MUTED → FAIL` status conversion), EXTRACT it to a pure function FIRST, then test the pure function directly. No mocks needed.

```
# ❌ BAD: 15 mocks to test a one-line status conversion
vi.mock("next/navigation", ...);
vi.mock("next/link", ...);
vi.mock("@/components/shadcn", ...);
// ... 12 more mocks ...
render(<StatusCell row={mutedRow} />);
expect(screen.getByText("FAIL")).toBeInTheDocument();

# ✅ GOOD: extract and test the logic directly
// In production code:
export function resolveDisplayStatus(status: string, isMuted: boolean): string {
  return status === "MUTED" ? "FAIL" : status;
}

// In test — ZERO mocks needed:
expect(resolveDisplayStatus("MUTED", true)).toBe("FAIL");
expect(resolveDisplayStatus("PASS", false)).toBe("PASS");
```

### Implementation Detail Coupling Rule

Tests must assert **behavior visible to the user**, not internal implementation details:

```
# ❌ COUPLED TO IMPLEMENTATION — breaks on any style refactor
expect(element.className).toContain("text-xs");
expect(element.className).toContain("-mt-2.5");
expect(element.className).toContain("border-border-error-primary");
expect(element.style.color).toBe("red");

# ❌ COUPLED TO INTERNALS — breaks when implementation changes
expect(mockService.mock.calls.length).toBe(3);  # Why 3? Brittle.
expect(component.state.isLoading).toBe(true);    # Internal state, not behavior.

# ✅ BEHAVIORAL — survives refactors, tests what users see
expect(screen.getByText("Error: Payment failed")).toBeInTheDocument();
expect(screen.getByRole("alert")).toHaveTextContent("Risk:");
expect(screen.getByRole("button")).toBeDisabled();
```

**CSS class assertions are NEVER valid test assertions.** If you need to verify visual styling:
1. Test the **semantic outcome** (e.g., element has `role="alert"`, text is visible, button is disabled)
2. OR use a visual regression tool / E2E screenshot comparison
3. NEVER assert specific Tailwind/CSS class names — they are implementation details

## Rules (Strict TDD specific)

- NEVER write production code before writing its test — this is the ONE rule that cannot be broken
- NEVER skip the GREEN execution gate — you MUST run tests and confirm they pass
- NEVER skip triangulation when the spec defines multiple scenarios — hardcoded Fake It must be forced out
- NEVER write trivial assertions (see Banned Assertion Patterns above) — they are WORSE than no test
- ALWAYS verify that every assertion CALLS production code and asserts a SPECIFIC expected value
- ALWAYS run the Safety Net before modifying existing files — protect what already works
- ALWAYS report the TDD Cycle Evidence table — the validation phase will check it
- If a test runner execution fails for infrastructure reasons (not test failures), report as "Blocked" and return — do NOT mark the task done
- Prefer pure functions — but don't force it where it doesn't fit (e.g., React components with state)
- For refactoring tasks, ALWAYS write approval tests before touching code
- Run ONLY the relevant test file during the cycle, not the full suite
- You own ONE task. Where the task and spec come from, and marking the task complete, are NOT yours — that is the orchestrator's job
